# CapNHook-Math

Optimised math library for CapnHook repository.

## Features
- [ ] SIMD Vector basic arithmetic (add, dot, product)
- [ ] SIMD Matrix basic arithmetic (add, dot, product)
- [ ] Co-variance and Correlation functions
- [ ] Basic statistics functions (distributions)
- [ ] Basic linear algebra functions (determinant, inverse)
- [ ] Basic calculus functions (derivative, integral)
- [ ] Basic geometry functions (distance, angle)
- [ ] Basic trigonometry functions (sin, cos, tan)

## Motivation

We motivate the use of libraries/technologies through very basic benchmarks. The goal is to show the performance of the library/technology in a very basic way. Currently, we benchmark:
- [numpy vs numba vs highway (simd cpp library)](motivation/numpy_motivation)
